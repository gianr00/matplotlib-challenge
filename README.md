Module 5 Challenge – The Power of Plots

Objective:

This project will apply the skills learned in Module 5 – Matplotlib. This utilizes the skills in telling the story behind the data through statistical analysis and creating plots. 

Project Details:
Analyzes the animal study data saved in csv files to compare the performance of a drug of interest, Capomuli versus the other treatment regimens.
 
Clean the data needed for analysis and creates the following summary reports :
-    Summary statistics for the treatment Capomuli 
-    Bar charts of total number of timepoints for all mice tested for each drug
-    Pie charts of the distribution of female or male mice in the study
-    Box plot of the final tumor volume for all four promising drugs
-    Line plot of tumor volume vs. time point for a mouse treated with Capomuli
-    Scatter plot of average tumor volume vs. mouse weight for drug Capomuli
-    Scatter plot of mouse weight vs average tumor volume for drug Capomuli showing the correlation coefficient and linear regression

Project Submission:
The following folders/files will be uploaded to GitHub repository called “matplotlib-challenge”. A shareable link of the GitHub repository will be submitted to bootcamp spot site.
-    Pymaceuticals/pymaceuticals.ipynb (folder/ file)
-    README.md (file)
